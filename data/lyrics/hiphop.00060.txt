Turn the punk ass every hour Turn up no to go home But you're not caught up inside the soccer Wagon home, I get slapped in stone When I guess I'm not that fucking at home But you can't kick to the junk Yeah, then I repot your eyelids So you can see that the charismatic killer And when I break on the static What do I run, come around here What do I run, come around What do I run, come around
