What trouble and follow me? All I wanted to be was a LLMC Ever since me did small as I yo Got to move What did you march off the down, Tyler? All you need Until my best friend caught you in arm head Right, team And ever since that day You know I hear me Things better mess R.I.P. goes to rock Drew, team God bless Listen now, why days I go see wife You just to kill me from stress Lay my head on her breast Sugar dumpling those best Explainin' all my problems to her Get in things off my chest I lay the hook and squeeze up And no more on my vest And your son Without my peeps, I'll be truly asked out
