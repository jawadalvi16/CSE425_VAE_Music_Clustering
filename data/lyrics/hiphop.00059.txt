Down there for a second, I'll get my wrong It's not a joke, but it can help And sell, this gotta happen in the mail I like a lot more of it, fat come up My double barrel bomb is getting me stoned I'm stealing, that's why I rent side Don't spill it, it smells like shit on the carpet Still it, those damn smoke when I get a cleaning I'm just gonna pee, fart, pee, smelly, reach it Shake my song, pump all night long And start take hits from the ball
