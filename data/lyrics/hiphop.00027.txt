Instead of golfers, the straws and signs Separated from the power like a unplug the blinds Dig this, another saviour, check the script, it's a myth Like a big spiss, it don't exist if you find the witness Don't forget this, the devil's in the pond and business They're gonna get shining business Oh, yeah, no plus, no one too So my jokes, am I you one too? The anxious after you, one too It's gonna be a food one too, understand Since sick man, you need a doctor, my knocker Better roll on praise
