I'm a man rocking a shotgun, I'm ticking, I'm talking, I can't stop with my body rods And I got hot like juxtastos, being mad straws Pat me the blanket, I'll be fucking the whole fuck Pull out the M to the C to the A and S to the W The vibes that we bust off the top of a gloss And my mouth is not butt, my fuck it Let me get down to the battle, guess I get funky and I shit with all my tits I'm like John The X rated nigga, listen to the shit, cuz I am the ill figure Everybody's getting any bigger than this
