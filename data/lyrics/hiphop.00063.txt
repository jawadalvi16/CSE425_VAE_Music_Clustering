Come on, your name is Alma Mouth like an ancient chant Got me like a dog as a poison pen Speaking of which, gotta leash and a wish Just to rock you men, make a militant move Peek my strategy, end of the day you're not mad at me Not dealing with nobody, now that's what you told me I said ayah, which is cool, we can just be friendly Cuz yo, put your me messing it up H'ma knock her up with the LC cups, she I'm on my jail, come on, push it and open it
