Cause I'm not a mix of top drags like Bugs like a fairy tale Yo, all girls, what's a great big way yo Like a faq girl who wrote the scale Who won't tell you, I won't tell The client tell I'm a sick sail Took a little cut top past and failed Break, cut up No need to let him skinz You got him, I wanna get rid of Hey baby, you're a shit big Night you're getting thin, you don't care about you Now, woody, woody, gotta care my sneakers I'm the way you got him, cause I hit him behind my street
