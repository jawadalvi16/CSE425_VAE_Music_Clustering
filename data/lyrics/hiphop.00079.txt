He didn't just say what I think he did, kitty And Dr. Draze said, nothing you idiot, Dr. Draze dead, he's locked in my basement Fuming to swim and love him and him Tick a tick a tick a slim, kitty, I'm sick of him Look at him walking around, grabbing as you know what, Lippin' that you don't, yeah, but he's so cute though Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms Because sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose my cat But it's cool for time, green to hop a dead moon My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little piss
