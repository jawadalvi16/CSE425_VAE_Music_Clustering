I'm not going to listen to it. It still keeps their purpose in mind. I want somebody who has a tortured soul. It's not worth it. I want somebody who will either put out for me or put me on my misery. Or maybe just put it all the words and make me go, you know? I've never heard it put that way. Make me go, what did you just say? I've never heard it put that way.
