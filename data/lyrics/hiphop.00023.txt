I can't stop a thing this one, you're bad to say You take a leap on, you speak fantasy Throw it's the way, make it down and tell a call for me Push it from the dark and empty choice Me, all I want, I can't jump I'm being all I want, I can't jump I do your best, I'm being stupid You never know you're still dead, I'm not your job Go ahead, see you again at exactly on top
