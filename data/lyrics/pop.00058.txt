You feel about this, try to control me boy, you get dismissed Pay my own final and I pay my own bills Always 50-50 relationships Choose on my beat, I fall in love I'm wearing a body, the rock I'm rocking I fall in love, I'm sad to paint lonely If I want to be the rock I'm wearing a body The house I live in, I fall in love I'm driving, I fall in love, I'm taking on you I depend on the hard women
