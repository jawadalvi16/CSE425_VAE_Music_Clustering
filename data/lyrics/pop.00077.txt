We're running through, hope you're all alone Cause I got plans with you, we could stay at home Or dancing hang on night, as long as I'm with you Doesn't matter what we do Don't let me see what I'm gonna do Oh what I'm gonna do, just know that I'm here with you Don't try to understand Just wait me there so long, still reek Cause you know how I am
