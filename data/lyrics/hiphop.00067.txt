I never let a statue tell me how nice I am Coming with more hits than the braves and the Yankees Living mad back like a hover size Mb The wackest ghouls try to diss it makes me laugh With my track records longer than a DC-20 aircraft So next time that you think you want something here Take something off my tech-back garbage to say else I'm making a fool of you, I'm not gonna make it I'm a bunch of memories, true I'm making a hit Yeah, I'm not a jerk, I'm a town I'm not a jerk, we are not gonna make it I'm making a hit, I'm not a jerk, I'm not gonna make it
