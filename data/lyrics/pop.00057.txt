There you are, come on baby, don't you want dance to me Get your hand in hand to me You got to do much better, it's gonna dance with me tonight You got to work your jet late, it's gonna dance with me tonight Remind this carefully, if you like what you'll see Move, go, prove you've been hangin' with me But I look like I just shook up and scared of me Go, go, just leave better time for the next time I don't think you ready, yeah, just get it I don't think you ready, but just get it
