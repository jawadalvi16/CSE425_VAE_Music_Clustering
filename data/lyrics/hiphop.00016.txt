Down with records from around the way Peace the man by the ad jazz he jays I'm rockin' on the mic from here to Bombay I'll give him a best and say come what Ray I'm concerned for what he's got to do today I'm lookin' sideways, I'm a man being laid They know I'm a homie, boom by day So fit up with faces and do Ray Sign to speak, open up, turn away Make this a sign for the glory and praise To be God, so socialized Open up your hands and clean out your eyes
