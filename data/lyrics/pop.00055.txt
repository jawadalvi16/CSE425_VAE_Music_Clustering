My feet, but you're just nonstop and it's not hot that you believe me messages every two minutes I'm in your stop by when I first met you You were cool, but it was game you had me food Cause 20 minutes after I gave you my number you already have my milk box full So what you bought a fair shoe, what now? Guess what I owe you, I have to know as much you do I give a back to be through with you and so what? I'm gonna like you, like you
