I can't yank the bug if you do the result We're end of carnival I am not an imbalore, I used to smoke the weed out I least I heed my heart and used to say I had to be out Sneaming on the thupies with the crazy woman back months Pushin' off in real hard just so we can have the dirt fun When I left my room, so the hour was bullet-bought status Battle in an empty was when tip was at its max It was one MC after one MC Was the worker they be one and sleep a little old me Do I have the formula to save the world Or was it just because I used to smoke the women and all the girls On the type of a bother with the queen
