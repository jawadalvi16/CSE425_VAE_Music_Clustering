I'm a liar to my people, only right you're making the dance flow Bad ass, better step to your business, a handle y'all, how you get away? Making your people just want to bounce a good busy Because you know the people, you're always a hit your own, what you say? You wonder why you feelin' the force And don't be worried cause you'll be ready to flow Smokey, cause I always put your arm And blow the spot to the very second, I'm gonna get you grip on Now that you tired, I hope you body be cool And my cousin keepin' you movin' that's what we doin' And you know where you gonna go And you know where you gonna go And you know where you gonna take your body away You know where you gonna go
