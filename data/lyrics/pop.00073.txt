This time, maybe we'll be in at a bar He'll drive a funky car Maybe we'll be in at a club And fall so deeply in love He'll tell me I'm on one And we'll be so much fun I'll be the girl of a strange Maybe, I'll like baby Come on, baby I got a guess on what to call my love I can't baby Come on, baby Come on, baby Come on, baby
