You spin me around and the earth is moving But I can't feel the ground Every time you look at me My heart is jumping, it's easy to see Nothing you need so much more More than anything I ever thought before You try me crazy, I just can't see You try me crazy, I just can't see Nothing you need so much more More than anything I ever thought before You try me crazy, I just can't see Nothing you need so much more More than anything I ever thought before
