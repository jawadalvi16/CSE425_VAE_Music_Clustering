I'm trying to break the dead man And I'm headed to watch a little baby And I'm over it, Jeff Every time I see you make my feel so fine Hot, beaten, crazy, my blood run wild Love and make me feel like a man and man and man Love me, baby, I know my life My love struck baby Damn, my love struck baby You got my love struck baby And I know just what to do And I know just what to do
