I'll be eating a thing in the shoe, I'm dreaming of you Who's pulling at the hottest spot tonight you're gonna find your pillars Rolling in the lexas, trucks and hummus So we say you got a girl, yes, true you got a man But the party ain't close to us, so let's make it out I'll be easy with your man at home The club is full of parlors and they practice full of gong And now you tell us we deal with our friends Cause you see lemon, three in the club Just jump, jump, jump, and please leave your man at home The club is full of parlors and they practice full of gong And now you tell us we deal with our friends
