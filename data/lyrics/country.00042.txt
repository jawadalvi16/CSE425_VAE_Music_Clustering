When you drink I can't hear you in your hands hanging over the sink But I don't wanna hear what you say in any way You been rocking the floor, rocking the floor Love you been rocking the floor, rocking the floor Love you been rocking the floor, rocking the floor And the seas getting in the wall stormy every day
