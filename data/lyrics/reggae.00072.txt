Because I read these things in prophecy When the rain stopped falling down and they got no water They're gonna bow down to the ground, wishing that they were under And when the stars stopped falling down and fires burning The grid out, there will be weeping and the gnashing of teeth Everyone will be morning, I will lots of people will be morning
