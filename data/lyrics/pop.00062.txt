I'll be thrown without you, but I'll win you You know that I'll be stabbed without you, I'm not part of it But I won't be thrown without you, no one knows that You know that I'll be helpless without you But I'm not a person that I'll be stressed without you But I'm chilling, you know that I won't live without you So I'm not healing, I'm not so bad I'm not so good, but I'm not so clever I'm so much harder, I'm so bad I'm not a man, I'm so bad I'm not so bad, I'm not so bad
