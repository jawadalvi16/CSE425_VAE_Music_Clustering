Why you're gone? White down for Babylon, MCs Babylon and Han I'm phenomenal, I keep the dopey odds Not italian, squint as shepa balance Like a leap of grain, like media is full The change won't like the pillars of Islam To make the best pool, the fuck the rest will It take one problem here, it's either clean as sass The next pool will be comprised of kings and queens We're a crowned and holding sceptre space And that gonna make it back as rain and biblical tecres I said necks with the gods, in the street of power Keep them past, written narrow
