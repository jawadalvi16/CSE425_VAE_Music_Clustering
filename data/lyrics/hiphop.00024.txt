I'm a baby women on TV where they have a tough memory What's it for without you, slight to crackin' And I'm always out lookin' for a free mail I hangin' hands around the doors when I drag it to the crib It's for a proxies Come on baby, feelin' it feelin' I make a lick of it every step I bring it Talk to the police and your grip I'm felling Devot it's on time and your mind is a villain Deathin' and the cracks up back I wanna see Lin' Such a such a need of pace that I'm doin' I'm talkin' to the girl, tellin' her all knowin' She's talkin' to the kid, you greasein' I'm felling her every lie
