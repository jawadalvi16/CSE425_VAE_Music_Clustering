Go into the soul! Go into the soul! You're sure you got into this place! You're sure he hates his race! I'm a slave, suicide! Hey, he's a transoption! Drive with peace with action, war! The beauty of death we all adore! I have no faith in distracted me! I know where your best will never be answered! Go into the soul! Go into the soul!
