The pedal to the storm and drown I live life in the fast lane I make a rural hash Hustle hard for cash So I could fall at that It's like she loves me, she loves me now Cause a prince mop a head full of bullshit alive I give a jewels that I call a fudgell Chanel bags I bought for boosters To the hood, I introduce the cheap fight fee Every now and then she wanna fight me Beats the same if I get knocked, she ain't gon' right me Sick party, pull that bullshit, it's like me A door to a knee A knee A door to a friend Don't see
