This place is my house, I might as well erase my face with white out Cause y'all can't see me like me since I'm brown Climbed out of a nice house, through the front window and heard this guy shout Hey, that's my car! Pull the night out, throwing the rhyme loud while I'm ripping the shit Put a clip in a spit by round, the murder you hold is worse than a convertible Clipping vertical nose first, put the top off, landing the side down You tie down the duct tape, caught great by random just on the slug leg
