I could have done it with dance with a family I can't live without your 40s, but I feel I am the only way My hip hip is a little free When you're with me, I'm gonna have that weight And you'll wait around and spread it away But here I stand here, I'm the nail When I hear some sound, then I fall And I feel like I'm gonna have that weight
