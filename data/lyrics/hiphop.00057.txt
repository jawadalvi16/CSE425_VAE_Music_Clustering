On the corner I want ya gonna roll on ya fool Hit ya with the golden wool Don't turn your back on the street When I hit that corner fill the concrete In the first act by lightning Watch me try to attack ya all of a sudden Fasten at these fools with the machine Look at the clock when it's time for some action Let it get home Make a shot So I let it get home Let it get home
