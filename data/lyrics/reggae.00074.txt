Why you're born, why you're from Babylon? MCs Babylon and Han, I'm from Namba, I keep the dopey odds Not italian, squint a sheep of balance Like a leopor, grain like meteorous stars The change won't like the pillars of Islam Make the best rule and fuck the rest rule It take one problem here and see the cleanest school The next school will be comprised of kings and queens We're a crowns and holding sceptre's face And that girl making records, great and difficult Techers, I sip necks with the gods Industry to power, keep them past, straighten out But while we vomit, I don't found what's about to happen
