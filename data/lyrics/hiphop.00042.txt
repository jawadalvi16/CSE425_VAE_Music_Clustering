I'm the whole sirens on this shit Who's dating his hip forever? Motherfuckers, this love, this 97 I ain't my niggas and my niggas rats That's doing like this I'ma rub your ass in a moonshine Let's take it back to 79 I'm warm and charmingly Tocco cheese for lots of peas and hot pot The seeds can't define it I'll be dropping these mockeries Drirically perform on robbery I'm a man who's a man who's a man who's a man Who's a man who's a man who's a man Who's a man who's a man who's a man who's a man
