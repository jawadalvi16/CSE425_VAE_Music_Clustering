My instinct is to kill and sink in the backstreet voice It doesn't matter cuz I got a scratchy voice Yo check it out but if you ask me I'm gonna be happy To lost see every member of the backstreet voice Getting a ass beat in the backseat of a taxi And dropped off on the real backstreet And somebody black sees five little rich white boys Looking like baggage with the in-world Painted on the back of the jacket Yo and I got a payment Can't stop there was suffering so far And this is just off the car to eat in my window
