So to a body sit down and wait Get my request to the DJ Cause my son he's gotta play And when I hear that beat I get my body up by my feet I grab a guy and move my feet He's playing my song Hey, come on play that song Play it for that long Just turn it up Just turn it up Play it, come on, need you play that song You know let it to me You know let it to me
