I said a hit, hop, the hit, the hit, the hit, the hit, the hit, the hit, the hit, the hop, you don't stop the rockin' to the band, man, but you say, up jump the booger to the rhythm, other booger to beat. Now what you hear is not a test, I'm rapping to the beat, and me, the groove, and my friends are gonna try to move your feet. You see, I am one, am I can't I like to say hello? I'm to the rock to the white, the red, and the brown, and the purple, and your low boogers.
