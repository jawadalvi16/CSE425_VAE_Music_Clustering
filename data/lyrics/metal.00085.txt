When you can't stand where the way I used to be I'm a woman, man, no time to talk Is it better than bringing a woman back in the round? It's time for me to fall It's alright, it's okay You're ready to look me out of the way A wicked try to understand But you don't like the back down there When the hell are you gonna stay alive? Stay alive I'm not gonna bring it in to everybody She's gonna die
