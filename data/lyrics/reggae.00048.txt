I'll be taking the strain, I'll be taking the west on train. I'll be going to a place where there is happiness. So you'll never ever see me again. So now I love Mustang. You'll never ever see me again, my friend. Cause I'll be taking the strain, I'll be taking the west on train. I'll be taking the strain, I'll be taking the strain, I'll be taking the strain.
