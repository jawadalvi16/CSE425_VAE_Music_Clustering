I'm gonna let her try Thank for her Can't do the better to cry Little bring it on the tail But I wanna hold on I'm not in the middle Don't sustain this tomorrow All we want is to drink your No! Got the job, drinking, drinking the money No! Got the job, drinking, drinking the money No! Got the job, drinking, drinking the money Drink it in my head Drink it in my head Drink it in my head Drink it in my head Here's my heart
