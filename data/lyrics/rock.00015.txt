I need to tell you the land, I stand on it I ain't my darkened brush all I'm buying for my pockets The receipts, the bus schedules, urgent napkin poems A matchbook, phone numbers all of which Lawn during a render, polpian, strange loose change The key is... Good, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes I asked if I care, I got the answer, I wrote it down somewhere I just gotta find it I just gotta find it
