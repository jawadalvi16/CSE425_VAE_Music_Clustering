The day the day America eats his young It defeats our women There is a gap so while we off the swimmin' Brownin' Get down there Get it Gotta go and all with it Sister, hey Old sister We're gonna be alright It takes a man to take a stand Understand it It takes a woman to make a stronger man As he buckets true They call me and breaks his head And I'm singing the song Oh my God My song I can't hold back So I can exact on the track It's an eye-by-eye Too much too much
